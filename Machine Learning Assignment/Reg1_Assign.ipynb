    "Where, y: dependent variable, x: independent variable, $\\theta_0$: y-intercept (bias), $\\theta_1$: solpe.\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "Let, there are 50 students in a class. Consider x(independent variable): hights of 50 students and y(dependent variable): weights of 50 students. If we want to predicts linear relation between weights and hights, then it is a simple linear regression problem.\n",

    "## Q6. Explain the concept of multicollinearity in multiple linear regression. How can you detect and address this issue?\n",

    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables in a data frame have a high correlation with one another in a regression model. This means that one independent variable can be predicted from another in a multiple linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of multicolinearity:\n",
    "1. **Structural multicollinearity:** This type occurs when we create a model term using other terms. In other words, itâ€™s a byproduct of the model that we specify rather than being present in the data itself. For example, if you square term $X$ to model curvature, clearly there is a correlation between $X$ and $X^2$.\n",
    "2. **Data multicollinearity:** This type of multicollinearity is present in the data itself rather than being an artifact of our model. Observational experiments are more likely to exhibit this kind of multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detection of multicolinearity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two simple ways to indicate multicollinearity in the dataset on EDA or obtain steps using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF):** Variance Inflation Factor is a measure of colinearity among predictor variables within a multiple regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $VIF = \\frac{1}{1 - R^2}$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    where, $R^2$ value is determined to find out how well an independent variable is described by the other independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Heat map or correlation matrix:** it is a correlation matrix with a color gradient background. This scale will be from 0â€“1 with 1 being perfectly correlated:\n",
    "\n",
    "    between 0.9 and 1.0 indicates very highly correlated variables;\\\n",
    "    between 0.7 and 0.9 indicate variables that can be considered highly correlated;\\\n",
