    "\n",
    "Yes, a clustering result can have high homogeneity but low completeness.\n",
    "\n",

    " The homogeneity of this clustering result would be high, as each cluster is highly pure in terms of sentiment.\n",

    "## Q8. What are some limitations of the Davies-Bouldin Index as a clustering evaluation metric? How can they be overcome?\n",
    "### Ans:\n",
    "#### Some limitations of the Davies-Bouldin Index:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sensitivity to the number of clusters:** DBI is sensitive to the number of clusters in the data. As the number of clusters increases, the index tends to decrease, even if the clusters are not well-separated. This can lead to overestimation of the clustering quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sensitivity to the shape of clusters:** DBI is sensitive to the shape and density of clusters. It works best when the clusters are spherical and have similar sizes and densities. In cases where the clusters are non-spherical or have different densities, DBI may not be an accurate measure of clustering quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Computationally intensive:** DBI requires computing pairwise distances between clusters, which can be computationally intensive for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### To overcome these limitations, some modifications to DBI have been proposed.\n",
    "1. One such modification is the **Modified Davies-Bouldin Index (mDBI)**, which addresses the sensitivity to the number of clusters by penalizing the index for the number of clusters. \n",
    "2. Another modification is the **Normalized Davies-Bouldin Index (nDBI)**, which normalizes the DBI by the maximum possible value, making it less sensitive to the number of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note:\n",
    "* Other clustering evaluation metrics can be used in conjunction with DBI to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the clustering quality.\n",

For example, some algorithms may work better with clusters of different sizes, shapes, or densities, which may affect the distribution of Silhouette Coefficient values.\n",

    "Yes, the Silhouette Coefficient can be used to evaluate hierarchical clustering algorithms.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Another issue to consider is that hierarchical clustering tends to produce clusters of varying sizes and shapes, which can affect the Silhouette Coefficient. To address this issue, one can use a modified version of the Silhouette Coefficient called the \"adjusted\" Silhouette Coefficient, which takes into account the size and shape of the clusters. The adjusted Silhouette Coefficient is calculated as the average Silhouette Coefficient over all data points, weighted by the size of their clusters.\n",
